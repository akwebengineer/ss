#  Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider

Defines the interface between a search provider and the Slipstream framework.  A SearchProvider is the interface between the Slipstream framework and a search service that accepts queries and produces query results.  Search providers typically do not render views.


The *Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider* function is the constructor for SearchProvider objects.

## Syntax

```javascript
    new Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider()
```

## Description

A Slipstream search provider is implemented as a Javascript AMD module in [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html) format.  The module must return a no-argument Javascript constructor that extends from *Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider*.  The framework will use this constructor to instantiate the provider.

```javascript
define(function() {
    function SearchProvider() {
       ...
    }
     
    // Inherit from the Slipstream SearchProvider class
    SearchProvider.prototype = Object.create(Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider.prototype);
    
    // Return the constructor as the value of this module
    return SearchProvider;
});
```

### Provider Lifecycle

A SearchProvider has a well-defined lifecycle that takes it through a series of states including *create*,  *start*, and *destroy*.

        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │   Launch Provider   │
        └─────────────────────┘
                   ↓ 
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │      onCreate()     │
        └─────────────────────┘
                   ↓
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │      onStart()      │
        └─────────────────────┘
                   ↓
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │  Provider active    │  
        └─────────────────────┘
                   ↓
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │     onDestroy()     │
        └─────────────────────┘
                   ↓
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │ Provider Terminated │
        └─────────────────────┘

Each state of a search provider has a corresponding lifecycle method in a SearchProvider object: *onCreate()*, *onStart()*, *onDestroy()*.

When a search provider is first created its *onCreate()* method is called.  By default this method is a no-op but providers can override it to perform any operations necessary prior to the provider being started. Once the *onCreate()* method returns, the provider's onStart() method is immediately invoked.

When a provider is either no longer needed (eg. its associated plugin is removed from the system) it may be destroyed. Before a provider is destroyed its *onDestroy()* method is called. This allows the provider an opportunity to perform any cleanup operations prior to it being destroyed.
  

**Note**: The destroy state and it's corresponding *onDestroy()* method are not currently used by Slipstream but are reserved for future use.

## SearchProvider Instances
All SearchProvider instances inherit from SearchProvider.prototype.

### Properties

### Methods

- #### SDK.SearchProvider.prototype.query
Send a query request to the provider.

  The method in the SearchProvider prototype is a no-op and should be overridden by objects implementing a SearchProvider.

    #### Parameters

    - **query**
      
      The query string to be executed

    - **options**
      
      An options hash to control query execution.  The options hash can contain the following keys:

        **success** - A callback to be called if execution of the query is successful.  This callback takes a single argument that is an object containing the query results.

        **error** - A callback to be called if execution of the query is unsuccessful. This callback takes a single argument that is an object containing the error response.

    - **page** - An object with the following attributes:

        - **index**: An integer value >= 1 representing the index into the set of results pages to be returned for the query.  Default is 1.

        - **size** - The size of result pages (in number of results) to be returned.  Default is 10.

### Declaring a SearchProvider 

A plugin must declare the search provider that it exposes via its plugin.json file.  Multiple search providers can exist in a given instance of the Slipstream framework.  In this case, search requests are federated over the set of search providers and the aggregate search result set is displayed.  

Each search provider must have a unique *uri* path.  For example, a search provider that searches online help might have the uri  "search:/help".  The empty path denotes the primary data object search provider.

A sample plugin.json with the relevant SearchProvider settings is shown below.

plugin.json:

```json
{
   ...
   
   providers: [
      {
          "uri": "search:/help",
          "module": "helpSearchProvider"
      }
   ]
   
   ...
}
```
When a plugin is loaded and the configuration includes a search provider, the module identified will be instantiated and the *onCreate()* function called to initialize the provider.
  
## Example
  
```javascript
  define(function() {
    function SearchProvider() {
        Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider.call(this);

         this.query = function(query, options) {
             $.ajax({
                 url: "/api/search/query",
                 data: {
                   qstr: query,
                   page: options.page.index,
                   pageSize: options.page.size
                 },
                 success: function(data) {
                    var results = data;
                    options.success(results);
                 }
             });
         }
    }

   SearchProvider.prototype = Object.create(Slipstream.SDK.SearchProvider.prototype);
   SearchProvider.prototype.constructor = SearchProvider;

    return SearchProvider;
});
  ```
