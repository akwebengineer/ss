# Plugin Manifest

Each plugin contains a manifest file in JSON format called *plugin.json*.  This file must exist in the root directory of the plugin's directory structure.  This file provides metadata describing the plugin as well as a declaration of the plugin's activities.

```javascript
{
    "name": "<plugin name>",
    "description": "<plugin description>"
    "publisher": "<publisher name>",
    "version": "MM.mm.rr",
    "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "min_platform_version": "MM.mm.rr",
    "activities": [
       {
          "auth_required": <true|false>,
          "module": "<relative_path_to_module>",
          "url_path": "<relative_url_of_activity>",
          "breadcrumb": <true|false>,
          "autostart" : <true|false>,
          "filters": [
             {
                "id": "<filter_id>"
                "action": "<action>",
                "data": "<data description>",
                "tags": "<array of keywords>"
             },
           ],
          "capabilities": [
              {
                 "name": <name of capability>
              }
           ]
      }
    ],
    "navigation_paths": [
       {
           "path": "path/to/navigational/element",
           "filter": "<filter_id>".
           "context": "<name of navigation schema context>"
       }
    ],
    "dashboard": {
        ...
    }
}

```

The attributes of the manifest are defined as follows:

**name**
A string containing the name of the plugin.  This string must not contain any characters that are unsafe in a URL.  If it does, the plugin will not be loaded.  

Plugin names must be unique within a given instance of Slipstream.  Plugin names that begin with an '_' are reserved and should not be used by application-level plugins.
       
**description**
A string containing a description of the plugin's purpose.
        
**publisher**
A string containing information about the plugin's publisher.
eg. "Juniper Networks, Inc."
        
**version**
The version number of the plugin in MM.mm.rr format where
            
MM = major version
mm = minor version
rr = revision
        
**release_date**
The date this version of the plugin was released in YYYY-MM-DD format where
            
YYYY = year
MM = month
DD = day
        
**min_platform_version**
The minimum framework version on which this plugin is defined to run, in MM.mm.rr format, where

MM = major version
mm = minor version
rr = revision
        
**activities**
A description of this module's activities.

- **module**
The qualified name of the Javascript module implementing the entry point of this activity.  Qualifiers are relative to the plugin's /js directory.    eg. "foo/bar/Module".

- **url_path**
The URL path associated with the activity.  This path is pushed to the browser's history when the activity is started and can be used for bookmarking and history navigation.  The URL path is formed by appending the *url_path* to the plugin name.  For example, if the plugin name is "dashboard" and the *url_path* is "configuration", the URL /dashboard/configuration is pushed to the browser's history when the activity is started.

- **breadcrumb**
Set this to *true* if launching the activity should result in the navigation breadcrumb being updated, *false* otherwise.  If not specified the default is *true*.  Suppressing breadcrumb updates can be useful for activities that do not render content to the main content pane.

- **autostart**
Set this to *true* if the activity should be started automatically after the UI is fully rendered.  The default value is *false*.

- **auth_required**
If *true* the user will be required to authenticate prior to the activity being launched.  If *false* no authentication will be required.  Default is *true*.

- **filters**
An array of filters defining the set of intents to which this plugin responds.  Each filter definition has the following attributes:
    - **id**
    The filter's id.  If specified, must be unique amongst all of the filters defined in the plugin.json file.

    - **action**
    The action that starts this activity.  eg. Slipstream.Intent.action.VIEW.

    - **data**
    An object that can contain any of the following attributes:
        - mime_type
        The MIME type of the data on which the activity can perform the defined action.

        -  scheme
        The URI scheme for which the activity can perform the defined action.
    
    - **tags**
    An array of keywords associated with this navigation path. 
    
     ```javascript
    eg. ["create", "firewall", "policy"]
     ```


- **capabilities**
An array of objects, each defining a capability that a user must have in order to access this activity.   If more than one capability is specified, then the user must have all of them in order to access the activity.  Each object has the following attributes:
    - **name**
    The name of the capability.  These names are defined by the underlying network management platform.

This activity will be launched via an intent if and only if the *action* and *data* specified in the intent match the filter's action and data attributes.
        
**navigation_paths**
A description of the navigation paths to be added to the framework's navigational elements.  Each navigation path contains the following attributes:

- **path**
The fully-qualified navigation path to the navigational element being defined.  Only two levels of navigation are currently supported.  eg. Devices/Security Devices

- **filter**
The id of the activity filter associated with this navigational element.  When a user selects the navigational element in the UI, an intent matching the referenced filter will be created in order to start the associated activity.

- **context**
The name of the context with which the navigation path is associated.  If this attribute is omitted the path will be associated with the default context.

 A navigation schema is defined in JSON format and wrapped by a requireJS module. The default schema is defined in the Slipstream configuration directory at *conf/navigation/schema.js*. Non-default schemas are found in sub-directories of *conf/navigation* that have the name of the context. For example, the schema for SRX device management might define the ‘srx’ navigation context and be stored in the following location:

 *conf/navigation/srx/schema.js*
 
  The corresponding nls files for this context  will be stored in:

 *conf/navigation/srx/nls*
 
 ###Example navigation schema
 
 ```javascript 
 define(function () {
    return [
        {
            "default": true,
            "name": "nav.devices_and_connections",
            "children": [
                {
                    "name": "nav.all_devices",
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "nav.profiles",
            "children": [
                {
                    "name": "nav.ips_profiles",
                }
            ]
        }
    ]           
});
```
Multiple navigation paths for the same activity may be provided.  This can be useful when a plugin is being shared between different applications and the activity is associated with different navigation paths in each application.   If more than one of the specified navigation paths exists in any of the active navigation contexts simultaneously then the behavior is undefined.  If a provided navigation path is not found in the associated navigation context then it will be ignored. 

**dashboard**
A description of the dashboard widgets this plugin implements. See the [dashboard documentation](public/assets/js/widgets/dashboard/dashboard.md) for details.
