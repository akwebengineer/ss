# Short Wizard Widget
## Introduction
A guided workflow in Slipstream can be implemented using one of the framework's wizard widgets.  The *Short Wizard* is a good choice for a workflow that requires a small number of steps - typically six or less.

The Short Wizard is composed of a set of *pages* each of which represents a step in the wizard workflow.  The wizard provides button-based navigation through the set of pages (Next, Back) as well as a *train* that indicates the available steps in the wizard and provides a way to navigate to a given page in a non-sequential manner. 
## API

#### Constructor

```javascript
function ShortWizard(conf) {...}
```

Used to create a new short wizard instance where *conf* is of the format:

```javascript
{
    showSummary: <Boolean or Custom View to determine if a summary page should be displayed. Optional. Default: true>,
    summaryTitle: <String containing custom title for summary page>,
    summaryEncode: <Boolean used to indicate the summary page values be encoded. Optional. Default: false>,
    customButtons: <Array of custom button configuration>,
    relatedActivities: <Array of follow on activities to the wizard>,
    customSuccessStatusFooter: <A custom view on the commit success page>,
    customErrorStatusFooter: <A custom view on the commit error page>,
    onClickRelatedLinks: <A function to be called when a related activity is selected>,
	container: <reference to the DOM element where the dashboard is to be rendered>,
	height: <number that defines the height of the short wizard in pixels, if it's absent, the short wizard height will default to 100% the available height>,
	onDestroy: <function callback to be called when the wizard is destroyed>
    onDone: <function callback to be called when the wizard completes normally>,
    onCancel: <function callback to be called if the user cancels the wizard>,
    save: <function callback to be called when the user submits data. Signature includes options object with success and error methods to be called by the user>
}
```

#####customButtons
The customButtons array represent the set of custom buttons that will be showed at the bottom panel of the Short Wizard. It's composed by a set of button objects with id, name and value. An optional parameter cssClass allows to set custom css class to the button. Another optional parameter isInactive allows to set the background of the button to an inactive color. 

For example, if the customButtons section has the following configuration:

```javascript
[
	{
		"id": "custom1",
		"name": "CustomBtn1",
		"value": "Custom 1",
		"cssClass": "short-wiz-custom"
	}
]
```
Then, the buttons section will be rendered as:

```html
<div class="left shortWizardCustomButtons">	 
		<input type="submit" class="slipstream-primary-button short-wiz-custom" id="custom1" name="CustomBtn1" value="Custom 1">
</div>

```

#### addPage

```javascript
function addPage(page)
```

Add a page to the wizard.  The view property is further explained [here](wizardPage.md).

Each page is represented by an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    title: <A string representing the title of the page>,
    view: <A view representing the page>,
    intro: <true if the page is an introductory page, false otherwise>
}
```

#### addPages

```javascript
function addPages(pages)
```
Add a set of pages to the wizard.

**pages** - An array of pages objects to be added to the wizard.


#### build

```javascript
function build()
```
Render the wizard into the container specified in the wizard's configuration object.


#### destroy

```javascript
function destroy()
```
Destroy the wizard elements and call the *onDestroy* method provided in the wizard's configuration object.


#### getCurrentPage

```javascript
function getCurrentPage()
```

Get the page index of the currently active wizard page.


#### nextPage

```javascript
function nextPage(skipBeforePageChange)
```
Move to the next page of the wizard.  This function has no effect if the wizard is currently on the last page.

**skipBeforePageChange** - A boolean value to decide if the wizard should bypass the beforePageChange callback. Passing true means the wizard won't trigger the beforePageChange callback. Otherwise, the wizard will operate as usual.


#### previousPage

```javascript
function previousPage()
```
Move to the previous page of the wizard.  This function has no effect if the wizard is currently on the first page.


#### gotoPage

```javascript
function gotoPage(page)
```

#### getNumPages

```javascript
function getNumPages()
```
