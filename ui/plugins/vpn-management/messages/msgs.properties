ips_sig_create_direction_tooltip=Select an option to specify whether IPS signature should match the pattern in traffic flowing in any direction, from client-to-server, or from server-to-client. 
ips_sig_create_pattern_tooltip=Enter a signature pattern of the attack you want to detect. An attack pattern can be a segment of code, a URL, or a value in a packet header. Then you create a syntactical expression to represent that pattern. The signature pattern is written in the Juniper Networks proprietary regular expression syntax.
ips_sig_create_regex_tooltip=Enter a regular expression to define rules to match malicious or unwanted behavior over the network. For example, the syntax \[hello\] has an expected pattern of hello, which is case sensitive. Matches include hElLo, HEllO, and heLLO.

ips_ordered_tooltip = Enable this option to create a compound attack object that must match each member signature or protocol anomaly in the order you specify. If you do not specify an order, the compound attack object still must match all members, but the pattern or protocol anomalies can appear in the attack in any order. A compound attack object detects attacks that use multiple methods to exploit a vulnerability
ips_anomaly_tooltip = Use the Add Anomaly page to detect unknown or sophisticated attacks that violate protocol specifications (RFCs and common RFC extensions). You cannot create new protocol anomalies, but you can configure a new attack object that controls how your device handles a predefined protocol anomaly when detected.

ips_sig_add_sig_form_title_help = Use the Add Signature page to configure the IPS signature protocol settings.
ips_direction_tooltip = Select an option to specify whether IPS signature should match the pattern in traffic flowing in any direction, from client-to-server, or from server-to-client.
ips_pattern_tooltip = Enter a signature pattern of the attack you want to detect. An attack pattern can be a segment of code, a URL, or a value in a packet header. Then you create a syntactical expression to represent that pattern. The signature pattern is written in the Juniper Networks proprietary regular expression syntax.
ips_regex_tooltip = Enter a regular expression to define rules to match malicious or unwanted behavior over the network. For example, the syntax \[hello\] has an expected pattern of hello, which is case sensitive. Matches include hElLo, HEllO, and heLLO.
